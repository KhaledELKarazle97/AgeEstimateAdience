# AgeEstimateAdience
Age and Gender Estimation Using Convolutional Neural Network with Adience Dataset

## Note
This project will completely focus on age and gender prediction using Adience dataset. The purpose of this project is to construct and compare the training complexity, prediction accuracy and possibilitiy of real-time application among different CNN network architectures.

## Prerequisites

 - Python 3
 - Tensorflow 1.1
 - OpenCV

## Getting Started

To Download the Entire Adience Dataset:
```
http://www.openu.ac.il/home/hassner/Adience/data.html
```

## Usage

### Preprocessing

 - mean_image.py Tool used to calculate either a mean image or BGR channels mean.

```
usage: compute_mean_image.py [-h] {bgr,img} ...

positional arguments:
  {bgr,img}
    bgr       generate three channels mean [compute_mean_image.py' -bgr -h]
    img       generate mean image [compute_mean_image.py' -img -h]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
```



### CNN Network



### Real-Time Prediction
