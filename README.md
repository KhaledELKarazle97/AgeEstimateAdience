# AgeEstimateAdience
Age and Gender Estimation Using Convolutional Neural Network with Adience Dataset

## Note
This project will focus on age and gender prediction using Adience dataset. The purpose of this project is to construct and demo popular CNN network architectures using Tensorflow with image classification task.

(Currently I'm updating a improved version of training script.) Refer to [another branch](https://github.com/zonetrooper32/AgeEstimateAdience/tree/old_scripts) to see old training scripts.

## Prerequisites

 - Python3
 - Tensorflow 1.0 or higher
 - OpenCV
 - Jupyter Notebook
 - h5py

## Getting Started

To Download the Entire Adience Dataset:
```
http://www.openu.ac.il/home/hassner/Adience/data.html
```

## Preprocessing

 -  Make_Dataset_For_Aligned.ipynb  Jupyter Notebook used to compress the entire Adience Dataset(aligned.tar.gz version)
 
 -  Make_Dataset_For_Faces.ipynb  Jupyter Notebook used to compress the entire Adience Dataset(faces.tar.gz version, which contains landmark infos)

 Note: Both Jupyter Notebooks use BGR mode for image reading and contain channel-wise mean calculation and mean image calculation. The train script uses channel-wise mean subtraction as preprocessing technique. 
 
 While both channel-wise mean subtraction and mean image subtraction are two of the popular preprocessing techniques, I would suggest to try channel-wise mean subtraction first if the backgrounds of the images in your dataset have a lot of variations. If preprocessing images from the source like a static camera(which has a high chance of "common background"), mean image is the way to go. 
 
 It should also be noted that VGG-Face model uses a BGR mean of [93.5940, 104.7624, 129.1863] for channel-wise mean subtraction, which is calculated originally from VGG-Face Dataset.

## CNN Network

Three networks architectures implementations are provided: GilNet, AlexNet and VGG-16. Check out papers for to see the architectures for each CNN:
