# AgeEstimateAdience
Age and Gender Estimation Using Convolutional Neural Network with Adience Dataset

## Note
This project will focus on age and gender prediction using Adience dataset. The purpose of this project is to construct and demo popular CNN network architectures using Tensorflow with image classification task.

(Currently I'm updating a improved version of training script.) Refer to [another branch](https://github.com/zonetrooper32/AgeEstimateAdience/tree/old_scripts) to see old training scripts.

## Prerequisites

 - Python3
 - Tensorflow 1.0 or higher
 - OpenCV
 - Jupyter Notebook
 - h5py

## Getting Started

To Download the Entire Adience Dataset:
